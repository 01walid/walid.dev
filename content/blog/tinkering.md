If you ask me how I would describe the solo-practice of software engineering, I'd sum it up to 03 skills:

- **Thinking rationally**: The ability to reason about a given problem in abstraction in a logical manner,
- **Conveying intent**: The communication skill with a mental precision to transfer that reasoning to the machine in a way it can process it as expected, 
- **Understanding systems**: This is what's often overlooked. And is what this post is mostly about. 

And I'm saying the "solo" practice because I'm intentionally removing the people/management vector from the equation. 


What got us -developers- to programming and computer science is often times the passion to create something and see it in-action, probably on a screen. You are taught how to fullfil this passion. Little attention is given to where that "something" you built is going to run, be deployed or behave within an environment.

With the rapid development happening in our industry, we've got "layers of abstraction" acting like piles of convenience that shorten the path to that end goal... build something. 

That *convenience* is even advertised. Like "X is being taken care of for you, focus on what matters", "make ship happen", "Forget X, focus on Y". That might lead you to think you're only valuable when you ship, build or help build something. Which is true, especially to businesses. But are you building on solid grounds? Are you correctly investing in yourself this way?

Those layers of abstraction are now packed. Providing entire dev "stacks". each layer is trying to cover its underlying system so "you don't have to deal with it"... Again, not necessarily harmful or bad, but I do think there are times to pause and reflect, what's the right level to choose a layer of abstraction? 

or even one-liner libraries.. 

Most developers, juniors but also some experienced ones, that I had the chance to mentor or work with tend to focus on dev stacks, tools, framework, and how to get things done. 
Some experienced ones take this a step further, like

As we progress, we continue learning ways to build more sophisticated programs, and to a lesser extent, where our program is going to be deployed.

the temptation to build something and get it out. 

Tinkering helps you make a great problem solver.

a builder, you are easily disposable
a problem solver, you're valuable.
