## Hello y’all
I’m Walid.

A software engineer from the [beautiful](https://www.google.com/search?q=annaba+algeria&tbm=isch) city of [Annaba, Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaba). Reaching a decade’s experience in general purpose programming and development, and it’s all like yesterday. 

I had the opportunity to work on some challenging problems, these include scaling Elasticsearch, creating software & infrastructures that process millions of records a day, deploying serverless apps with AWS Lambda, tinkering with Unicode and ligatures with Golang, or even chasing memory leaks within Python programs...

I had especially an extensive Python experience using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis. I helped to build one of Algeria's first SAAS-based Learning Management System (LMS): coursella.com, I love making CLIs, I’m a Linux fan and I mostly live in the terminal, 
I get obsessed with making systems and programs run safer and faster, so I sometimes switch gears to Golang, static typing and compile time checks.

On the social side, I like to advocate for opensource, I helped to organize a Linux install party, a [local Hackathon](http://hackathonannaba.com/en), a [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/3533), local [dev workshops](https://www.annaba.tech/), or a jury in the [Algeria Web Awards](https://www.awa.dz/) national competition, I used to [blog and write tech news in Arabic](https://www.it-scoop.com/author/dzgeek/).
