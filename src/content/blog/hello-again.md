It's been a while since I wrote anything on a space of mine. Lazy meâ€¦ 

I'm starting to feel like I have words to say, knowledge to share and experiences to show. Stories to tell? Nah, I don't like drama much..

This blog is a comeback from my old, archived, personal blog, that was mainly in Arabic. I might add an archive section with the old posts within. But for now, I'm liking the fresh start, focusing on dev stuff ... you can see I followed the hype and got my `.dev` domain.

If you know me and think I should be sharing stuff on a specific dev topic, please reach me out via social media. I'll do my best!
